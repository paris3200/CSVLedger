# CSVledger
Convert CSV fanancial transactions to ledger journal


CSVLedger converts a CVS file downloaded from a fanancial instution into a
ledgercli journal file.  Currently it is under development and not ready for
production use.  However, if you're ok with editing some Python code to set
some account variables it will work.

```
 csvledger --help

  --check             prints all transaction without an expense/income
                      category.
  --total             prints sum of all credit and debit transactions
